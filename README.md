# React Timer Challenge App (Refs & Portals Tutorial)

## Overview

This demo app illustrates the use of **Refs** and **Portals** in React. It allows users to set their name and participate in timed challenges. The app features a countdown timer for different levels of difficulty and displays results through a modal dialog using **Portals**.

## Features

- **Player Input**: Users can enter their name using an input field managed by React's `useRef` hook.
- **Timer Challenges**: Multiple levels of timed challenges are available, each using `useRef` for timer handling.
- **Result Modal**: Results are displayed in a modal dialog that is rendered outside the parent DOM hierarchy using **Portals**.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with Hooks: `useState`, `useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, and **Portals**)
- **CSS** for styling
- **HTML** for the DOM structure
